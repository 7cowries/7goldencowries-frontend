## Status Update

Unable to complete requested full-stack feature scope within the provided environment. Only the frontend repository is available locally, and backend repository access or production configuration details are absent. The large feature set (quests, subscriptions, social connect, leaderboard, profile, wallet session, TON verification) requires backend changes, environment secrets, and integration testing that cannot be executed here.

If additional repositories, environment variables, and production-aligned services are provided, these tasks can be addressed in a structured follow-up.
