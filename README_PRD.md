All features, flows, and copy must match the PRD.

## Frontend Scope (per PRD)
- React app with TonConnect (global “Connect Wallet”)
- TON-only payments UI (token sale with live TON pricing)
- Quest engine (All / Daily / Social / Partner / Insider)
- Staking UI (stake, rewards, claim)

## Usage
- Always read the PDF first
- Implement by PRD phases; don’t invent endpoints—extend PRD first, then code
